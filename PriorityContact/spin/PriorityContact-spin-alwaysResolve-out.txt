	+ Partial Order Reduction

Full statespace search for:
	never claim         	+ (alwaysResolve)
	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	acceptance   cycles 	+ (fairness disabled)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

State-vector 44 byte, depth reached 50, errors: 0

       56 states, matched
      154 transitions (= visited+matched)
        0 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         0 (resolved)

  the model contains 13 never claims: pNoLongerNeededSucc, pResolvedSucc, pAppointmentScheduledSucc, pConversationInProgressSucc, pLaunchedSucc, pNeededSucc, pNoLongerNeeded, pResolved, pAppointmentScheduled, pConversationInProgress, pLaunched, pNeeded, alwaysResolve
  only one claim is used in a verification run
  choose which one with ./pan -a -N name (defaults to -N alwaysResolve)
  or use e.g.: spin -search -ltl alwaysResolve PriorityContact.pml
